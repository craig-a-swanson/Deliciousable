Hello, thank you for taking the time to review my project. I tried to comment as best could, but please let me know if you have any questions or would like a better understanding of decisions.

### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features
The main landing screen is the list of recipes in condensed format. There is a small photo, name, cuisine. If a source link exists, the recipe name is tappable. The toolbar contains three buttons: on the left is an option to change the view format, the globe allows the user to filter the list, and the right "info" button contains necessary icon attribution.

When tapping on the lower left toolbar button the view will toggle between the condensed format and the expanded format. The expanded view contains a larger image and a link to a YouTube video as well.

If the device is in landscape, there will be two columns to make use of the extra space.

A sheet will appear when tapping on the globe toolbar button. Filter the recipe list by desired cuisine types.

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
In setting my priorities I wanted to focus on:
  1. An intuitive and responsive user interface (to show my focus on ultimately creating an app that is pleasant and easy to use);
  2. Items that were specifically mentioned in the requirements (to show that I can incorporate guidelines and requests and accommodate client needs when building an app);
  3. Providing comments, as necessary, to make reviewing the code easier (to show that I do not overlook details and try to maintain solid coding practices; as well as showing that I am a collaborater and understand that I am part of a team working on a project together).

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I am answering the above two questions with one description. Over the course of a week I spent roughly 15-20 hours on the project, which included reviewing some elements I have not used in awhile, such as NSCache. Since there was no deadline given, I attempted to strike a balance with delivering a rich and full app while also understanding that the time is not limitless. 
I wanted to be complete but deliver the project in a timely manner. To this end, my biggest trade-off was likely a more polished UI design with complimentary colors and interesting layouts of elements.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The testing covers 53% according the Xcode coverage report. I thought this was adequate, but understand that more testing can be done. I wanted to use Swift Testing to show my familiarity and willingness to incorporate new frameworks.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
My use of sheets was a bit of a stretch on the constraint of one screen displaying the list of recipes. I kept the one screen but thought the modal sheet was a good compromise of presenting new information in a transitory view.

Aside from that, it was a fun project! It prompted me to review some material I haven't used in awhile, NSCache, and also forced me to provide useful results in a minimalist way. I enjoyed working on it, thank you!
