Hello, thank you for taking the time to review my project. I tried to comment as best could, but please let me know if you have any questions or would like a better understanding of decisions.

### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features
The main landing screen is the list of recipes in condensed format. There is a small photo, name, cuisine. If a source link exists, the recipe name is tappable.

Same view but expanded for a larger image and a link to a youtube video as well.

If the device is in landscape, there will be two columns to make use of the extra space.

A sheet will appear when tapping on the globe button. Filter the recipe list by desired cuisine types.

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
In setting my priorities I wanted to focus on:
  1. An intuitive and responsive user interface (to show my focus on ultimately creating an app that is pleasant and easy to use);
  2. Items that were specifically mentioned in the requirements (to show that I can incorporate guidelines and requests and accommodate client needs when building an app);
  3. Providing comments, as necessary, to make reviewing the code easier (to show that I do not overlook details and try to maintain solid coding practices; as well as showing that I am a collaborater and understand that I am part of a team working on a project together).

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I am answering the above questions with one description. Over the course of a week I spent roughly 15-20 hours on the project, which included reviewing some elements I have not used in awhile, such as NSCache. Since there was no deadline given, I attempted to strike a balance with delivering a rich and full app while also understanding that the time is not limitless. 
I wanted to be complete but delivering the project in a timely manner. To this end, my biggest trade-off was likely a more polished UI design with complimentary colors and interesting layouts of elements.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The testing covers 53% according the Xcode coverage report. I thought this was adequate, but understand that more testing can be done. I wanted to use Swift Testing to show my familiarity and willingness to incorporate new frameworks.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
My use of sheets was a bit of a stretch on the constraint of one screen displaying the list of recipes. I kept the one screen but thought the modal sheet was a good compromise of presenting new information in a transitory view.

Aside from that, it was a fun project! It prompted me to review some material I haven't used in awhile, NSCache, and also forced me to provide useful results in a minimalist way. I enjoyed working on it, thank you!
